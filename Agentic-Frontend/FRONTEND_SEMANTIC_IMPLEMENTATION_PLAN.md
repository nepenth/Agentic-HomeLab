# Frontend Semantic Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to align the frontend with the expanded Composable Semantic Orchestration platform backend. The backend has been significantly enhanced with 150+ new API endpoints across 5 phases, introducing advanced AI capabilities, workflow automation, analytics, and intelligent content processing.

**Current State**: The frontend API service and TypeScript types are already comprehensive and well-implemented, covering most backend endpoints.

**Key Gaps**: Missing specialized UI components, pages, and modern agentic design patterns to fully leverage the backend capabilities.
