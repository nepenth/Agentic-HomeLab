# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing AI agent backend to support dynamic agent creation and management through a flexible, extensible architecture. The system will allow frontend applications to define, create, and manage specialized agents with custom behaviors, data schemas, and storage requirements without requiring backend code changes. This addresses the need to support diverse workflows like email analysis and knowledge base creation while maintaining architectural flexibility for future agent types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to dynamically create specialized agents through API calls, so that I can build diverse workflows without requiring backend modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontend sends an agent creation request with a schema definition THEN the system SHALL validate and create the agent with custom configuration
2. WHEN an agent schema includes custom data models THEN the system SHALL dynamically create or validate the required database tables
3. WHEN an agent is created with tool definitions THEN the system SHALL register and make available the specified tools for that agent type
4. IF an agent creation request contains invalid schema THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation errors
5. WHEN an agent is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the agent configuration and available capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want agents to have flexible data storage capabilities, so that different agent types can store their results in appropriate formats and structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent defines custom result schemas THEN the system SHALL create corresponding database tables or collections
2. WHEN an agent stores results THEN the system SHALL validate data against the agent's defined schema
3. WHEN querying agent results THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe access to custom data structures
4. WHEN an agent schema is updated THEN the system SHALL handle database migrations safely
5. IF storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to discover agent capabilities and schemas, so that I can build appropriate user interfaces and interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting agent information THEN the system SHALL return the agent's schema, capabilities, and available operations
2. WHEN listing available agents THEN the system SHALL include metadata about each agent's purpose and data requirements
3. WHEN an agent has custom result types THEN the system SHALL provide schema information for frontend consumption
4. WHEN agent capabilities change THEN the system SHALL provide versioning information
5. IF an agent is deprecated THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want to define custom processing workflows and tool integrations, so that agents can perform specialized tasks beyond basic LLM interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining an agent THEN the system SHALL support custom processing pipeline definitions
2. WHEN an agent requires external integrations THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin architecture for tool registration
3. WHEN processing tasks THEN the system SHALL execute custom workflows according to agent definitions
4. WHEN tools are invoked THEN the system SHALL handle authentication, rate limiting, and error recovery
5. IF custom processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want dynamic agents to integrate seamlessly with existing monitoring and logging, so that I can maintain operational visibility across all agent types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dynamic agents execute tasks THEN the system SHALL log activities using the existing logging infrastructure
2. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN the system SHALL report metrics and traces consistent with static agents
3. WHEN monitoring agent performance THEN the system SHALL provide unified metrics across all agent types
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide consistent log formats and correlation IDs
5. IF an agent type has performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide agent-specific monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want dynamic agent creation to maintain security boundaries, so that malicious or poorly designed agents cannot compromise system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating agents THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all schema definitions
2. WHEN agents access external resources THEN the system SHALL enforce permission boundaries and rate limits
3. WHEN storing agent data THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate access controls and encryption
4. WHEN executing agent code THEN the system SHALL run in sandboxed environments with resource limits
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log incidents and disable problematic agents

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to version and manage agent definitions, so that I can iterate on agent designs while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating agent definitions THEN the system SHALL support versioning with backward compatibility
2. WHEN deploying new agent versions THEN the system SHALL allow gradual rollout and rollback capabilities
3. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL route requests to appropriate versions based on client requirements
4. WHEN deprecating versions THEN the system SHALL provide migration paths and sunset timelines
5. IF version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance
